# Simple pomodoro clock

This is a very simple but customisable HTML, CSS and JS web "Pomodoro" clock. 

* Open index.html in a browser to "run" the project.
* Set the amount of minutes you want to set to study and the amount of minutes you want to set to rest. If you leave it empty or as it is (with the placeholder values) it will assign 25 minutes to study and 5 to rest.
* The `Start` button starts the clock. The label will tell you that is `time to study`. When the study minutes have passed the label will change to `rest`. Once the rest minutes have passed the label will go back to `time to study`.
* Once you have started the clock the button will change to `Stop`. If you click it, the clock will reset itself back to 00:00:00, stop, and the button will change to the initial state of `Start`.
